<h1>Basketball</h1>
<h2>Basketball is a sport where you try to get a ball into the other hoop.</h2>
<p>Commonly referred to as hoops, basketball is a sport of many things, including skill, size, and luck. The ability to make a shot on a hoop 6ft 9in high (im guessing) is very useful in the long run because you can make more shots and score more points. You can also use some height if you wanna play basketball. You can play being smaller, but that gets hard. For instance, lets say I were 6 foot 1, I would mostly be gaurded by people who were 6 foot 9, a lot taller than me. But, you could still play being smaller than the others.</p><h2>Small legends</h2>
<p>There are people in basketball that are smaller than others, which is perfectly OK because they are able to <em>slip</em> past  the defence. For instance, Steph Curry, a highly skilled basketball player, is only 6 feet and 2 inches, which is shorter than most NBA players. He can make half court shots and easy layups.</p>
<h2>Tall legends</h2>
<p>There are also very tall people that are very skilled at the game. One of the best players of all time is Micheal Jordan, which can dunk all the way from the 3-point line. Or Shaq, which is 7 foot 3 (ish).</p>
<h2>NBA</h2>
<p>The National Basketball Assocation, or the NBA, is the place where the best of the best go and get payed millions to play basketball and entertain people. Heres how it works, </p>
<ul>
    <li>Every year, college players get drafted to higher paying teams.</li>
    <li>The teams make the money by having fans pay money to see the games.</li>
    <li>During certain points in the season, players can get traded to another team.</li>
    <li>The better games are played, the better pay players get. </li>
    <li>There are 50 teams in the NBA to be in.</li>
</ul>
