<h1>Drums</h1>
<p>Drums are a <strong>very</strong> loud instrument. It is the also the only instrument that does not need amplifacation. Drums are used across all music genres (except dj). They typically come in 5-peice sets with 2-3 cymbals. Here is an example:<br> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wM8_Z1mjQ0w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br>They are typically played in songs, but are also for fun. I have one in my house. <strong>They are loud.</strong> They are a very crucial instrument to keeping a beat. Almost no band can exist without them. They are <em>so important</em>, that there are mostly 3-4 people on a band(<em>drums</em>,bass,guitar,voice).</p>
