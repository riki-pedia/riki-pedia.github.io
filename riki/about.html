<h1>About The Maker</h1>
<p>Hi! I am the programmer of this website, and my name is Ricky Kelley. I got an intrest in computers when I was just a little kid. I used to play games on the family computer. I messed with the browser and learned my way around the computer. When I was 9 years old, I found Kahn Academy.<br> Not long after, I found computer coding on Kahn Academy, where I learned basic JS (javaScript). When I decided I was finished with js, I decided I needed to learn <strong>more code.</strong><br>By the time I finished js, I was 11 years old and ready to learn how to make websites. So, I took the HTML and CSS courses on Kahn Academy, and it payed off! I now make projects for my friends using either js or html. I decided to learn code because I thought it would be fun and cool. I was right! <br> <br> This webpage is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a><br>Now go on <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming"> Kahn Academy</a> and become a fellow coder! I even made my own logo:</p>
