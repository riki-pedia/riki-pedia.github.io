<h1>Coding on Windows</h1>
<h4>Coding on Windows may seem hard at first, but it is actually pretty easy.</h4>
<h5>There are a few things making it seem hard, like "which app?","how do i save?","what?", but those will become easy once you are done reading this!</h5>
<p>You start out by finding a suitible tool to type the begining text in, like <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/coding-on-windows-rikipedia/4506564194254848">Khan Academy</a>. Next, you plug a drive into your computer. Then, open Windows Powershell and put in command <code>new-item E:\name.html</code> (or<code> D:\name.html</code>). It should look something like this:<br><img src = "https://riki-pedia.github.io/riki-docs/idk.png" width ="250"><br> Next put your <code>html code</code> into the <code>set-content (your file path)</code> command. Use single quotes for the command. Itg should look a little like this:
    <br><img src = "https://riki-pedia.github.io/riki-docs/idk2.png"><br><br>Thats it!! Well done!!!
