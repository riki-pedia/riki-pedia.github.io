<h1>What It Is Like Being A Web Dev</h1>
<h4>There are many tools and shortcuts to web developing, but not all of them work.</h4><h4>For instance, there is <a href = "https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, a free* website builder where you can use templates, make files, and even host a website. There is also <a href = "https://github.com">GitHub</a>, a free website hosting service, where I host Rikipedia. But why am I talking about hosts? You need to know about the <code>code</code> itself. You could use many languages of code to make many different things. I use <code>html</code> to make my websites, but there is a lot more, including <code>javascript, ruby, python, php</code> and many more. html is a good place to start because it is easy to learn and easy to debug.<br> I learned how to use html on <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Kahn Academy</a>, which is also where I test my code before it is uploaded.<br><br> There are many other services and apps to try,  but stick with what you like.</h4>
        <h5>*Mostly free</h5>
