<h1>Go Kart Racing</h1>
<p>Go kart racing is a sport for children (mostly). It is played by driving a racing kart around and trying to be the fastest. It is kind of like training to be in NASCAR, a competitive, major league variation of go kart racing. There are many places you can do it, including a local place in Reno called <a href = "https://www.need2speed.com/">Need 2 Speed</a>. There are many more and to find them, just Google "go kart racing near me".</p>
